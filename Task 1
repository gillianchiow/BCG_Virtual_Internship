Dear [Name of Lead Data Scientist],

  After discussing in-depth with the team, it is known that the significant churn problem are driven by power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe and the
  problem is largest in the SME segment.We would need the following data in order to hypothesise of whether the churn is driven by the customers' price sensitivity 
  using predictive model.
    - Primary data: 
        i) Customer Feedback: reason of terminating service, a feedback form should be offer to the customer to understand the situation; rating for service; rating for price satisfaction 
    - Secondary data:
        ii) Customer database: customers' details including residing country, industry, electricity consumption history, sign-up for service date
        iii) Churn data: To indicate whether the customer has churned
        
  We may conduct the testing accordingly with the predictive model such as logistics regression, random forest, regression tree. The most effective (highest complexity, explainability 
  and the accuracy) model will be selected. After aligning the predictive model, we can use the model to test the direction and magnitude of the price on customer churn rate. We can 
  remain the variable as control and see whether there are any other factor affected the current situation. Last but not least, we can adjust the discount strategy according to the result
  gotten from the predictive model testing.
  
  Have a nice day! Please do not hesitate to add-on any additional comment on the suggested solution. We may discuss accordingly.
